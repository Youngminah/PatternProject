## 01. [Taylor Approximation]

1. Define a differentiable function that maps from real number to real number.
2. Define a domain of the function.
3. Plot the function.
4. Select a point within the domain.
5. Mark the selected point on the function.
6. Define the first-order Taylor approximation at the selected point.
7. Plot the Taylor approximation with the same domain of the original function.
