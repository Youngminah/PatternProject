## 07. Ploynominal fitting.

[Polynomial fitting]

Solve a least square problem to find an optimal polynomial curve for a given set of two dimensional points.

Demonstrate the effect of the degree of polynomial in fitting a given set of points.

- choose a polynomial curve and generate points along the curve with random noise

- plot the generated noisy points along with its original polynomial without noise

- plot the approximating polynomial curve obtained by solving a least square problem

- plot the approximating polynomial curve with varying polynomial degree
