## 05. Kmeans Clustering on the spatial domain.

[K-means clustering on the spatial domain]

Apply K-means algorithm to the regular grid of a spatial domain in two dimension with varying number of clusters.

The spatial domain can be represented by two matrices where one matrix represents the horizontal index and the other matrix represents the vertical index.

Define a distance between each spatial point (x_i, y_i) and a centroid (c_x^k, c_y^k) for cluster k using L2-norm square and L1-norm.

Visualize the result using color coding scheme that distinguishes different clusters.

Observe the trajectory of centroid during the optimization and the shape of the clusters depending on the distance.
